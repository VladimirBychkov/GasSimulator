# Gas Simulator

The main goal of this project is to test a few simple collision detection algorithms and multithreading. 

## Prerequisites 

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler supporting C++23 or later (it's very likely lower versions will work too)
- CMake (version 3.20 or higher)
- SFML library for visualization (the simplest way is perhaps to use vcpkg package manager)
